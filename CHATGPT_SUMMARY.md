# AI Shop Project - Complete Summary for ChatGPT 5

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is a **dual-purpose Next.js application** that combines:
1. **AI Shop Marketplace** - A public marketplace where customers can buy/sell AI automated systems
2. **AI Sales Agent + Lead Tracking** - A private personal tool for the owner to sell AI Receptionist services to businesses

---

## PROJECT PURPOSE

The owner wants to:
- Create a marketplace platform where people can create and monetize AI automated systems (like AI receptionists, content creators, etc.)
- Have a personal AI agent that calls businesses to pitch their AI Receptionist service
- Track leads generated by the AI agent in a CRM-like system

---

## TECH STACK

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Dependencies**:
  - React 18.3.0
  - Prisma Client 5.14.0

## DESIGN AESTHETIC

**Current Design**: Minimal dark theme inspired by cosmos.so
- Background: `#0a0a0a` (near black)
- Text: White with gray-400 for secondary text
- Borders: `border-white/10` (subtle white borders with opacity)

- No neon effects, no glassmorphism (previous iterations had these)
- Clean, minimal, professional

**Previous Design Iterations**:
- Initially: Blue primary theme
- Then: Red theme inspired by cosmos.com
- Then: Futuristic with neon accents and glassmorphism
- Current: Minimal dark (cosmos.so style)

## DATABASE SCHEMA (Prisma)

```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  email         String    @unique
  name          String?
  password      String
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt
  products      Product[]
  purchases     Purchase[]
  reviews       Review[]
}

model Product {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  description String    @db.Text
  price       Float
  category    String
  imageUrl    String?
  demoUrl     String?
  status      String    @default("active")
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
  creatorId   String
  creator     User      @relation(fields: [creatorId], references: [id])
  purchases   Purchase[]
  reviews     Review[]
  
  @@index([category])
  @@index([status])
}

model Purchase {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  productId   String
  product     Product  @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
  amount      Float
  status      String   @default("completed")
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  @@index([userId])
  @@index([productId])
}

model Review {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  productId String
  product   Product  @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
  rating    Int      // 1-5
  comment   String?  @db.Text
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  
  @@unique([userId, productId])
  @@index([productId])
}
```

**Note**: The schema does NOT include models for:
- Leads (lead tracking uses mock data currently)
- Calls (call history uses mock data currently)
- Contacts (contact management uses mock data currently)

These would need to be added for full production functionality.

   - No user authentication implemented yet

3. **Payment Processing**:
   - Stripe is installed but not integrated
   - No payment flow implemented

4. **AI Agent Telephony**:
   - Twilio integration structure exists but not connected

   - Text-to-speech (ElevenLabs) not implemented
   - Real calling functionality not working

5. **File Storage**:
   - No file upload system for AI system files

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES NEEDED

Create `.env.local`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ai_shop"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your-stripe-secret-key"
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="your-stripe-public-key"
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+1234567890"
```

---

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up database**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

3. **Run development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access application**:
   - Marketplace: http://localhost:3000
   - Agent Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/agent
   - Leads: http://localhost:3000/agent/leads

---

## ROUTES SUMMARY

### Public Marketplace Routes:
- `/` - Homepage
- `/products` - Browse products
- `/products/[id]` - Product detail
- `/create` - Create product (requires auth)
- `/dashboard` - Creator dashboard (requires auth)
- `/about` - About page
- `/login` - Login/signup
- `/cart` - Shopping cart

### Private Agent Routes (Owner Only):
- `/agent` - Agent dashboard
- `/agent/contacts` - Contact management
- `/agent/calls` - Call history
- `/agent/leads` - Lead tracking dashboard
- `/agent/leads/[id]` - Individual lead detail
- `/agent/settings` - Agent settings

### API Routes:
- `/api/agent/call` - Call processing
- `/api/agent/call/webhook` - Twilio webhook

---

## DESIGN DECISIONS

1. **Two Separate Systems**: Marketplace and Agent are separate but in same codebase
2. **Mock Data**: Lead tracking, calls, and contacts use mock data for preview
3. **Minimal Design**: Chose cosmos.so minimal aesthetic over futuristic/neon
4. **Centralized Images**: Product images managed in single file for easy updates
5. **No Authentication Yet**: Pages are accessible but auth not enforced

---

## KEY FILES TO REVIEW

1. `app/page.tsx` - Homepage design
2. `app/agent/leads/page.tsx` - Lead tracking dashboard
3. `app/agent/leads/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual lead page
4. `lib/agent/conversationEngine.ts` - AI conversation logic
5. `components/Navbar.tsx` - Navigation with Agent/Leads links
6. `app/globals.css` - Tailwind configuration and custom styles
7. `lib/productImages.ts` - Product image URLs

---

## NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION

1. **Add Database Models**: Create Lead, Call, Contact models in Prisma
2. **Implement Authentication**: Set up NextAuth.js with provider
3. **Connect Real Telephony**: Integrate Twilio for actual calling
4. **Add Speech Recognition**: Implement OpenAI Whisper
5. **Add Text-to-Speech**: Implement ElevenLabs
6. **Payment Integration**: Connect Stripe for marketplace purchases
7. **File Storage**: Set up AWS S3 or Cloudinary for AI system files
8. **Email Notifications**: Set up email service for notifications
9. **Deploy**: Deploy to Vercel, Railway, or similar platform

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- **Lead Tracking is for Owner**: The `/agent/leads` system is NOT for customers - it's the owner's personal CRM
- **Mock Data**: Most agent features use mock data - need database integration
- **Port Conflicts**: If port 3000 is in use, run `npm run dev -- -p 3001`
- **Design Evolution**: Project went through multiple design iterations (blue → red → futuristic → minimal dark)

---

## PROJECT GOALS

1. Help people create and monetize AI automated systems (marketplace)
2. Provide owner with AI agent to sell AI Receptionist services
3. Track and manage leads from AI agent calls
4. Create beautiful, modern, minimal UI
5. Build scalable architecture for future features
