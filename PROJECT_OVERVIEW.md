# Project Overview: Who Uses What?

## 🎯 Two Separate Systems in One Project

### 1. **AI Shop Platform** - FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS

**Purpose:** A marketplace where people can buy and sell AI automated systems

**Who uses it:**
- ✅ Your customers browse and buy AI systems
- ✅ Creators sell their AI products
- ✅ Anyone can create an account and list products

**Pages:**
- `/` - Homepage (marketplace)
- `/products` - Browse all AI systems
- `/products/[id]` - Product detail pages
- `/create` - Create new AI system (for creators)
- `/dashboard` - Creator dashboard (track sales)
- `/about` - About the marketplace
- `/login` - Customer/creator login

**Example:** Someone buys your "AI Receptionist" product from this marketplace

### 2. **AI Sales Agent + Lead Tracking** - FOR YOU (PERSONAL USE)

**Purpose:** Your personal sales tool to sell AI Receptionist services directly to businesses

**Who uses it:**
- ✅ **ONLY YOU** (not your customers)
- ✅ Tracks leads when YOUR AI agent calls companies
- ✅ Helps you close sales for YOUR AI Receptionist service

**Pages:**
- `/agent` - Your AI agent dashboard
- `/agent/contacts` - Companies you want to call
- `/agent/calls` - Call history from your AI agent
- `/agent/leads` - **Lead tracking system** (tracks businesses interested in YOUR service)
- `/agent/leads/[id]` - Individual lead details
- `/agent/settings` - Configure your AI agent

**Example:** Your AI agent calls "Tech Solutions Inc" → They show interest → Lead created in `/agent/leads` → You follow up and close the sale

---

## 🔄 How They Work Together

1. **You use the AI Agent** (`/agent`) to call businesses and pitch your AI Receptionist service
2. **Interested companies become leads** tracked in `/agent/leads`
3. **You close those sales** and can later offer that service through the AI Shop platform (`/products`)
4. **Or** you could sell your AI Receptionist as a product in the marketplace for others to buy

## 💡 Summary

| System | Who Uses It | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **AI Shop** (`/products`, `/dashboard`) | Your customers & creators | Marketplace to buy/sell AI systems |
| **AI Agent** (`/agent`, `/agent/leads`) | **YOU ONLY** | Sell YOUR AI Receptionist service to businesses |

---

## 🎯 The Lead Tracking System

The **Lead Tracking System** (`/agent/leads`) is **FOR YOU**:

- ✅ Tracks leads generated by YOUR AI agent
- ✅ Helps YOU manage YOUR sales pipeline
- ✅ Shows YOU which businesses are interested in buying YOUR service
- ✅ **NOT** visible to your customers
- ✅ **NOT** part of the marketplace

**It's your personal CRM to manage leads when selling AI Receptionist services!**
